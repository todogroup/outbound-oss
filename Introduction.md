# Introduction

## Goal and target audience

This guide of how to contribute to or launching an OSS project (so-called outbound open source) aims for a complete and lean process, that can be implemented in large as well as in small and medium sized companies. Of course not all steps of the presented procedure need to be implemented in a small or medium sized company.

## Motivation why to contribute to OSS projects or launching own OSS projects

There are many different reasons for companies to contribute to existing OSS projects, the following list of examples does not claim to be complete, it only provides an impression about different motivations.
* Build software faster and better
  * Integrating “our” features into upstream projects makes maintenance a lot easier
  * Upstream versions can be directly used in offerings
  * We obtain more features in shorter period of time
  * We achieve higher quality in shorter period of time
  * Support available from core experts
* Exercise strategic influence
  * Safeguard free of charge access to certain functionality
  * Gain (co)copyright on OSS packages
  * Influence the direction of the upstream OSS project
  * Establish de facto standards
  * Access to the creativity of everyone interested in software
  * Keep competitors out of certain market segments
  * New ways of collaboration with suppliers and customers may be established
  * Create and maintain ecosystems
* Attract, grow and retain talent
  * Increase developer satisfaction
  * Peer review of each contribution by core experts improves quality and boosts developer skills
  * Make company visible as an attractive employer
  * Improve company's reputation, and with it the standing of developers in their communities
 * Get closer to the customer
    * Establish new ways of collaborating with suppliers and customers

## Maturity levels

Corporate adoption of open source can typically be described using a model of maturity levels. These levels characterize how, with growing maturity, open source is used in an increasingly effective fashion to drive value and realize business needs. How outbound open source is handled is a distinguishing factor between the different levels of maturity. A critical factor is the insight that influencing the open source ecosystem is mainly done by participation and doing work as contributions to open source projects.

A typical maturity model of corporate open source adoption will look like this (see for example [Haddad: Open Source Program Offices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-program-offices-primer-organizational-roles-haddad)):

0. Denial - No or unconscious use of open source
1. Consumption - Passive use of open source software
2. Participation - Engagement with open source community
3. Contribution - Pragmatic contributions to open source projects
4. Leadership - Strategic involvement with open source to drive business value

To advance from one level to another it requires certain initiatives and structural and organizational elements.

Going from consumption to participation will start with informal engagement and low-effort activities such as reporting bugs in upstream projects driven by technical needs. Decisions about open source contributions will be ad-hoc and be taken for individual cases.

Establishing decision making processes and formalizing contribution policies will lead to the next level. A typical step on this level is to establish an Open Source Program Office to support open source engagement and maintain open source strategy and process.

On the leadership level, processes are mature and have to be scaled. Corresponding tooling needs to be made available. Own projects with the goal to create new open source communities will be started. This will typically come with leveraging open source foundation to enable cross-company collaboration to strategically use open source to accelerate creating business value.

The subsequent sections of this document will described how these defining elements on the maturity levels of open source adoption can be shaped in organizations.
